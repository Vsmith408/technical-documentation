          Flexbox is the new way to style your all elements. It can help with
          everything from aligning elements, to distributing space between items
          in a container. This is especially helpful when you don't know the
          size of the element. Flexbox is normally used on small-scale layouts,
          compared to the grid system which is used on large-scale layouts.

          You begin by going into your CSS file and typing in the parent element
          you want to call. Once you do this, you will set the element to "
          <strong> display: flex;</strong> ". It's that simple! You can then
          define what properties you want to add to the element. You have now
          made that item a flex-container. The parent element is known as the
          <em>flex-container</em>, meaning that is the element you have set to
          flex. The children in this element are now known as
          <em>flex-items</em>.
        </p>

        <header>Parent Properties</header>
        <p>
          Below are the different types of properties you can use on a parent
          element, along with a brief description.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Display : This property allows you to set a flex container</li>
          <li>
            Flex-direction: There are four directions you can use with this
            property.
            <ul>
              <li>
                row: this aligns your items from left to right
              </li>
              <li>row-reverse : this aligns your items from right to left</li>
              <li>column: aligns your items from top to bottom</li>
              <li>column-reverse: aligns your items from bottom to top</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When you're typing this in your CSS document, it will look like
              this:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
.container {
    flex-direction: row || row-reverse || column || column-reverse;
}
            </code>
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Flex-wrap: This allows you to determine where you want your text to
            go to the next line. This has three ways to do this:
            <ul>
              <li>nowrap: all items will be on one line</li>
              <li>wrap: items will wrap from top to bottom</li>
              <li>
                wrap-reverse: items will wrap onto a new lne from bottom to top
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When you're typing this in your CSS document, it will look like
              this:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code>
.container {
    flex-wrap: nowrap || wrap || wrap-reverse;
}
              </code>
              </pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section id="child_properties" class="main-section">
        <header>Child Properties</header>
        <p>
          Below are the different types of properties you can use on a child
          element, along with a brief description.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Flex-grow: This property takes a unitless value and determines what
            portion of the space in the container it should take up. You can
            enter whatever number you'd like; however, negative numbers are not
            accepted.
            <p>
              When you're typing this in your CSS document, it will look like
              this:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code>
.item {
  flex-grow: (number);
}
              </code>
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Flex-shrink: This allows the item to shrink as necessary.
            <p>
              When you're typing this in your CSS document, it will look like
              this:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code>
.item {
  flex-shrink: (number);
}
              </code>
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Flex-basis: This determines the default size of the item. You can
            use a number or a keyword.
            <p>
              When using this in your CSS document, it will look like this:
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code>
.item {
  flex-basis: length || keyword(auto);
}
              </code>
            </pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Flex: This allows you to shorthand your Flexbox properties. It is
            recommended to use the shorthand version. However, the flex-shrink
            and flex-basis properties are not required.
            <p>
              When using this in your CSS document, it will look like this:
            </p>
            <left>
              <code>
                <pre>
.item {
  flex: [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'> || <'flex-basis'> ]
}
                </pre>
              </code>
            </left>
          </li>
        </ol>
